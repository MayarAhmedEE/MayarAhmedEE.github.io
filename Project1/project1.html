<p id="about-socrat-p1">He was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy, and as being the first moral philosopher of the Western ethical tradition of thought.An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' Travel Journal provides important information about Socrates' youth. There is no doubt that Socrates' work and life is very inspiring, <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/">CLICK HERE </a>if you want to know more.</p>

			<h2 id="h2">Description</h2>
<p id="p2-description">Socrates (469-399 B.C.) was a classical Greek philosopher who is credited with laying the fundamentals of modern Western philosophy. He is known for creating Socratic irony and the Socratic method (elenchus). He is best recognized for inventing the teaching practice of pedagogy, wherein a teacher questions a student in a manner that draws out the correct response. He has had a profound influence on Western philosophy, along with his students Plato and Aristole. Though much of Socrates' contribution is to the field of ethics, his input to the field of epistemology and logic is also noteworthy.</p> </div>

			<h2 id="h2">Socratic problem</h2>
<p id="p3-SocraticProblem">Scholars and historians who try to gather accurate information about Socrates face a peculiar problem, known as the Socratic problem. This problems arise due to 3 key features - There is no proof that Socrates ever wrote anything, philosophical or biographical.
Whatever information we derive about Socrates is from the works of 4 scholars namely - Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, and Aristophanes. The writings are in an artistic and creative style, therefore creating a doubt whether these details are truth or fiction.So the information on Socrates that is available cannot be proved and has no historical evidence.</p> </div>
         
          <div id="Life">
			<h2 id="h2">Life</h2>
<p id="p4-Life">Details of Socrates' life can be obtained from writing of his associates and students, Plato, Aristophanes and Xenophon. There is no proof that Socrates himself wrote anything. Most of whatever we know of him is through Plato's works like 'The Apology'. Socrates was primarily know for his ideas, communication skills and public teachings. His views  reflected through his associates' works. Socrates' father was Sophroniscus and his mother Phaenarete, a midwife. Socrates married Xanthippe, who was much younger than him and he had three sons, Lamprocles, Sophroniscus and Menexenus.</p> </div>
